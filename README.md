## Introduction
When Europeans experience a heavy temperature drop in winter, chances are
that a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) has happened. This phenomenon is
characterized by a strong temperature increase in the stratosphere, possibly up to
50 °C within a few days. Being able to predict these events can help meteorologists
improve weather forecasting. In this work, we aim to classify and predict SSWs.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt for the prediction
of this phenomenon using Machine Learning approaches.

## Setup
1. Set the environment variables.
Default values for spaceml servers are given here:
`scripts/load_environment_variables.sh`

2. Copy the simulated and real data to the corresponding folders

3. Run the preprocessing (see below)



## Preprocessing

How to run:
1. Check and adjust environment variables. Default values can be loaded via 
`source scripts/load_environment_variables.sh`
2. (Optional, depends on your configuration) Load your python virtual environment:
`source YOUR_ENV/bin/activate`
3. Run the preprocessing scripts for both the simulated and real data:
`python code/run_preprocessing.py`
`python code/run_preprocessing_real.py`
4. Run the labeling script:
`python code/run_label_generation.py`

In order to run the code you have to set up your PYTHONPATH to the code folder
```export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/where/the/code/folder/is/"```


## Classification

### RandomForest and Histograms

Go to the `code` folder and execute this script:
`python classification/run_randomforest_classification.py`
The results will be written to the results file defined by the environment variable `DSLAB_RESULT_FILE`

### CNNs

Go to the `code` folder and execute this script:
`python classification/cnn.py`
The results will be written to the results file defined by the environment variable `DSLAB_RESULT_FILE`

If the resulting Pytorch model weights is to be persisted, use `--savemodel` flag and set `CNN_WEIGHTS` environment variable to the directory where the model weights is going to be persisted.

### XGBoost
By going to the `code` folder and executing this script:
`python classification/xgboost_simple.py` you can see the following output:

```
usage: xgboost_simple.py [-h] [-d {CP07,U65,ZPOL_temp,U&T}]
                         [-sp SIMULATED_PATH] [-rp REAL_PATH] [-dt {sim,real}]
